first day leet code:
  Today I attended a club meeting for leet code for the first time, we covered leetcode problem 100 and 124.
  If I'm to be honest I lacked an understanding of how trees and data structure works. I personally believe that I need to practice and studying this subject more.
  I need to practice understading data structures as well as understanding functions and figuring out what language I wish to program in.
  I need to reassess my problem approaching strategies and methods.
      -lacks direction when coding
      -lacks fundimental necessities for analysis
      -lacks formal and proper skills required to answer problems
end of first day.
